# Third-Party Notices

`simplifi-mcp` is a Rust rewrite that derives its knowledge of the Quicken Simplifi
internal web API — and portions of its design (endpoint constants, request/response
shapes, sync strategy, MCP tool surface) — from the following MIT-licensed projects.
Their copyright and permission notices are reproduced below as required by the MIT
license.

This project is **not affiliated with or endorsed by Quicken Inc.** The Simplifi API it
speaks to is undocumented and unsupported.

## krconv/quicken-simplifi-mcp

The primary upstream. Its TypeScript MCP server was ported to Rust; endpoint constants,
data models, the SQLite sync strategy, and the MCP tool schemas derive from it.

## apderosso/Quicken-Simplifi-API

Referenced for the web-UI CSV-import format (`Date, Payee, Amount, Tags`) and as

from it (it drives the web UI via Playwright).
